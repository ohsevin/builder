## Programmatically build web servers

[/builder](http://systemssolutiondesigner.com) is a general purpose, personal, server configuration manager built with Node.js. Allows you to easily build and deploy web services and applications (webpage/etc) on any Linux cloud or private server. Builder is a proof of concept and is currently in development phase.

## Full software stack management

/builder allows you to be creative by stacking components. A component is a modular container of code, images, build/test scripts and other assets. /builder links the components together and deploys onto your server automatically. 

## Add new abilities to your server by dropping them in

Drag and drop components into a new context. Edit the component variables then click build. Headless Chrome is used to display the web app being rebuilt.
